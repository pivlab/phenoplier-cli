# Introduction

This package serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for the [PhenoPLIER](https://github.com/haoyu-zc/phenoplier?tab=readme-ov-file) project. PhenoPLIER is a flexible computational framework that combines gene-trait and gene-drug associations with gene modules expressed in specific contexts. This CLI program aims to provide a more user-friendly interface for users to interact with the PhenoPLIER project and integrate it into their own computational pipelines.
