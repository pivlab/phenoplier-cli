This folder contains code to run though null simulations using data from UK Biobank. 

The core code is organized in Python modules. The Jupiter notebooks are used to run the simulations and to visualize the results, by calling the functions in the modules. This is done in order to make the code more readable, testable, and to facilitate the reproducibility of the results.

The _config.toml file is used to store the configuration parameters for the simulations.
